%
% MCRoomSim is a multichannel shoebox room simulator used to generate 
% reverberant room impulse responses of any user defined rectangular room.
% 
% In addition to a standard set of source/receiver types (omni, cardioid, 
% dipole, etc.), MCRoomSim is also able to simulate sources/receivers with
% directivity defined by Spherical Harmonic functions (up to a specified
% order) as well user defined directivities. These user defined sources/ 
% receivers can be specified as a series of custom directional gains
% or custom directional impulse responses.
%
% For multichannel receivers such as microphone arrays, MCRoomSim maintains 
% phase information of sound arriving between all channels of the receiver.
%
% 
% For Spherical Harmonic type receivers, MCRoomSim provides the option of
% applying a Near Field Compensation filter to the soundfield.
%
% Many of the key simulation parameters are easily configured using a
% series of MATLAB functions.
% 
% Uses for MCRoomSim include:
%   * Simple echoic simulations to obtain room impulse responses of a room
%     with particular features
%   * Simulation of a speaker array setup in a room by using custom sources 
%     defined with directional impulse responses matching that of the 
%     speakers.
%   * Simulation of arbitrary microphone arrays in an echoic room by using 
%     a multichannel custom receiver with each channel being defined
%     with a series of directional impulse responses matching that of the 
%     individual microphones of the array.
%   * Obtaining the spherical harmonic expansion up to a specified order at 
%     any point within an echoic room using a spherical harmonic type
%     receiver.
%   * Head Related Impulse Responses for an echoic room can be obtained by
%     setting up a 2 channel custom receiver with each channel being
%     defined with the anechoic directional impulse resposnes (HRTFs) for a
%     particular ear.
